# Vimeo
This is a web extension that displays some details about a video - hosted at vimeo.com - being played (or not) in your browser.

## How it works
A **content script** is injected when visting websites, and you can check by clicking on this extension's icon if any video has been detected.
If so, this popup makes a GET request to *player.vimeo.com* with the right *Referer* header and retreives the data.

You can choose *a video to open* using buttons.You also have access to some more stuff like *video quality*, owner's vimeo url, and so on.
